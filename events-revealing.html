                    CSA’s Big and Little program is one of the most important parts of our organization. Every year, new joining CSA members
                    become Littles when they are paired with, or are “picked up by,” veteran CSA members. These veteran members that they are paired with
                    will become Bigs if it is their first time being paired with Littles. If they have picked up in previous years, they simply pick up
                    more Littles if they choose to do so!<br><br>
                    The lines of Bigs and Littles that can span over several years come together to form families. You can view CSA’s different
                     families at the “Fams” tab at the top of this page. As senior Bigs graduate, other Bigs in their line and families pick up more
                     Littles and keep the family sizes strong!<br><br>
                    The most exciting for many CSA members is the process of Passing and Revealing. Passing begins with CSA board secretly pairing
                     future Bigs and Littles, and only telling the Bigs who their Littles are, but keeping everything a secret from Littles. Passing is
                     generally a 3-week long process in which Bigs troll, drop subtle hints, and give gifts for their Littles while keeping their own identities
                     secret.<br><br>
                    At the end of Passing is Revealing, which is a day when Littles try to figure out who their Bigs are. At the end of the day,
                     the Bigs reveal their identities and they are finally united with their Littles! This whole process is full of excitement and chaos for
                     everyone and ends up bringing together Bigs and Little to form bonds that last for years on end.<br><br>
