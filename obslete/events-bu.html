                     &emsp;CSA hosts an annual banquet to commemorate and honor the graduating seniors of our organization who have
                     touched all of our lives in a meaningful way during their time with CSA. Unfortunately, due to the preexisting
                     circumstances of this year, we were not able to hold this banquet.<br><br>
                     &emsp;However, this would not stop us from celebrating the time that we have spent with our seniors! To end the
                        Spring quarter and ultimately the 2019-2020 school year for CSA, we hosted a live watch party of a compilation of
                        shoutouts from CSA members for this year’s seniors!<br><br>

               <div class="event-description">
                   <p>&emsp;&emsp;CSA’s Big and Little program is one of the most important parts of our organization. Every year, new joining CSA members
                      become Littles when they are paired with, or are “picked up by,” veteran CSA members. These veteran members that they are paired with
                      will become Bigs if it is their first time being paired with Littles. If they have picked up in previous years, they simply pick up
                      more Littles if they choose to do so!<br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;The lines of Bigs and Littles that can span over several years come together to form families. You can view CSA’s different
                       families at the “Families” tab at the top of this page. As senior Bigs graduate, other Bigs in their line and families pick up more
                       Littles and keep the family sizes strong!<br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;The most exciting for many CSA members is the process of Passing and Revealing. Passing begins with CSA board secretly pairing
                       future Bigs and Littles, and only telling the Bigs who their Littles are, but keeping everything a secret from Littles. Passing is
                       generally a 3-week long process in which Bigs troll, drop subtle hints, and give gifts for their Littles while keeping their own identities
                       secret.<br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;At the end of Passing is Revealing, which is a day when Littles try to figure out who their Bigs are. At the end of the day,
                       the Bigs reveal their identities and they are finally united with their Littles! This whole process is full of excitement and chaos for
                       everyone and ends up bringing together Bigs and Little to form bonds that last for years on end.<br><br>

               &emsp;&emsp;CultureFest is an annual celebration of culture at Cal Poly that takes place during Fall quarter. Many of the
                  cultural clubs, including CSA, share a bit of the culture that they each represent with the school in a number
                  of ways. <br><br>
               &emsp;&emsp;For CSA, we shared our culture with others through our performing groups and food! CultureFest featured
                  performances from CSA’s own Lion Dance Team, Take Out Kidz dance group, and Harmonics a cappella group (learn more
                  about them in the “Groups” tab above)! CSA also sold Indomie noodles with egg and Spam add-ons for anyone to purchase
                  and enjoy!<br><br>

               <p>
                  &emsp;&emsp;Ultraman is the first major event for new Littles to begin to really get familiar with CSA. Ultraman occurs very
                     early on in the quarter and introduces Littles and new CSA members to the families of CSA.<br><br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;Ultraman is a friendly Olympics-style competition that takes place between CSA’s many families, with each family
                     represented by a different color theme. Because new CSA members and Littles have not yet been paired with families or Bigs,
                     they are instead temporarily assigned to random families, so that they can become more familiar with their assigned family
                     and the Bigs within it.<br><br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;Everybody competes in a variety of games throughout the day at the beach, and one family eventually emerges
                     victorious! Ultraman is a great way to get connected with CSA members, both returning and new.<br><br>

                     meet other new members as well as veteran CSA members!<br><br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;Our Meet & Greet takes place during the day on Dexter Lawn, a popular spot for gatherings on campus. Various
                     activities are held and everybody has the opportunity to mingle and meet with tons of new people.<br><br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;Later in the day, CSA brings members to a nearby beach for a bonfire event! The bonfire is another great
                     opportunity to meet new people, and has tons of great music and campfire snacks, such as s’mores!<br><br>
